###How To Use:

Simply add 'scroll-fade-in' as a class for any HTML element. 

you can adjust Y-axis offset by adding a 'data-offset' attribute with an integer as value to the HTML element you are fading.

####Example:

```html
<div class="scroll-fade-in" data-offset="40">
</div>
```

The example above will fade in the div once the whole div minus 40px off the bottom is shown in the window.
